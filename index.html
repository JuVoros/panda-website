                <p>From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava
                    river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.

                    SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move
                    toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward
                    the tower.

                    OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to
                    one side and moves away from the tower.

                    ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some
                    CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and
                    miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant
                    collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.

                    OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his
                    old Master.

                    OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and
                    puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.

                    OBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.

                    ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.

                    ANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .

                    OBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.

                    ANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

                    OBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost!

                    ANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.

                    ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps
                    toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.

                    OBI-WAN: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

                    ANAKIN: You underestimate my power!

                    OBI-WAN: Don't try it.

                    ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in
                    the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the
                    lava.

                    ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove
                    has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.

                    OBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith,
                    not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.

                    OBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.

                    ANAKIN: I hate you!

                    OBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

                    ANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and
                    starts SCREAMING.

                    215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

                    OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he
                    struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.

                    He runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.

                    216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

                    OBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the
                    SKIFF.

                    C-3PO: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this
                    dreadful place.

                    OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.</p>
